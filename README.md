# Anycubic-4Max-Classic-Firmware
Since Anycubic discountinued the original 4Max and replaced it with their 4Max pro they also removed the firmware from their website, after using archive.org and finding the firmware I decided to put it here in order to prevent another poor soul from spending countless hours trying to get their original firmware and their printer back in working order.
